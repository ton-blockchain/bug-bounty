# TON security bug bounty

If you find a critical bug or vulnerability in the TON Blockchain (in the C++ code of the main repository) or TON main services (standard wallets, bridge, standard smart contracts), you can send its description and exploitation scenario and receive a reward.

We are interested in critical vulnerabilities: crash, loss/theft of coins, etc.

You can target a reward of up to $100,000 in Toncoins for vulnerability, depending on the severity; large bounties for severe vulnerabilities are given with 1 year lock-up.

Let's perfect the safety and security of TON together!

Send general reports to [@ton_bugs_bot](https://t.me/ton_bugs_bot). Reports about frontend should be sent to [hackenproof page](https://hackenproof.com/programs/ton-society) (check Frontend section below).

_We reserve the right not to review some reports._

Priority list:

## TON Blockchain Core (C++)

https://github.com/ton-blockchain/ton.

Catchain, Validator Node, Full Node, DHT Node, TonLib, FunC compiler, Fift compiler.

The testnet branch is considered experimental and often undergoes tests and audits. We are interested in identifying problems at this stage, thus bugs in the testnet branch are accepted, in some cases report review maybe postponed till the end of audit/tests (you will be immediately notified upon report submission).

## Smart Contracts (FunC)

Standard smart contracts - https://github.com/ton-blockchain/ton/tree/master/crypto/smartcont:

- Network config - `config-code.fc`;

- Elector - `elector-code.fc`;

- Wallets - `simple-wallet-code.fc`, `wallet3-code.fc`;

Wallet V4 and subscription smart contracts - https://github.com/ton-blockchain/wallet-contract. 

Multisig - https://github.com/ton-blockchain/multisig-contract

TON-Ethereum Toncoin bridge and TON-BSC Toncoin bridge - https://github.com/ton-blockchain/bridge-func. 

TON-Ethereum Token bridge - https://github.com/ton-blockchain/token-bridge-func. 

Nominator pool - https://github.com/ton-blockchain/nominator-pool.

Fungible, Non-Fungible, Semi-Fungible tokens - https://github.com/ton-blockchain/token-contract. 

TON DNS - https://github.com/ton-blockchain/dns-contract

## Solidity 

TON-Ethereum Toncoin bridge and TON-BSC Toncoin bridge - https://github.com/ton-blockchain/bridge-solidity.

TON-Ethereum Token bridge - https://github.com/ton-blockchain/token-bridge-solidity.

## Python

MyTonCtrl validator tools - https://github.com/ton-blockchain/mytonctrl.

HTTP API - https://github.com/toncenter/ton-http-api, https://toncenter.com.

Python SDK - https://github.com/toncenter/pytonlib.

## Frontend

All issues related to sites and frontend should be sent to [hackenproof page](https://hackenproof.com/programs/ton-society).

Note that the standard recommendations from the OWASP (e.g. adding the recommended HTTP headers) will not be highly appreciated or will rejected.

The most valuable are real vulnerabilities and critical bugs.

We do not accept reports about open IP addresses or open ports, if this does not lead to an attack (ddos is not considered in this case).

Web Site - https://ton.org.

[Web Wallet](https://wallet.ton.org) and [Browser Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ton-wallet/nphplpgoakhhjchkkhmiggakijnkhfnd) - https://github.com/toncenter/ton-wallet, 

JavaScript SDK - https://github.com/toncenter/tonweb.

JavaScript Mnemonic SDK - https://github.com/toncenter/tonweb-mnemonic. 

TON-EVM bridge [frontend](https://ton.org/bridge) - https://github.com/ton-blockchain/bridge.

## Third-party

Third-party TON services that you can find for example on https://ton.app are also interested in finding security bugs.

In particular, popular products like https://tonkeeper.com, [@wallet](https://t.me/wallet), [@cryptobot](https://t.me/cryptobot), [@donate](https://t.me/donate), https://tonwhales.com, https://getgems.io,  https://disintar.io/, https://tonscan.org.

Please contact them directly if you find a vulnerability.
